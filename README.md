libvcetoy
=========

Toy project to play around with new VCE support in amdgpu:
https://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/drm/commit/?id=cb850ceb0f25117bccb557545a3ea7a54472df80

Also testing the waters with my first meson project.

Extra Build Targets
-------------------

Not implemented yet.

The following extra build targets are supported:
 * format: formats the code in place
 * cppcheck: run some basic static analysis on the code
